		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many of the studies have investigated the prevalence and nature of self-medication. It is a common type of self-care behavior among the populace of various countries. World Health Organization promotes the practice of self-medication for effective and quick relief of symptoms without medical consultations to reduce the burden on health-care services, which are often understaffed and inaccessible in rural and remote areas. AIM: The aim of the study was to determine the extent and pattern of self-medication among the population (patients) attending pharmacies at study sites and to note the association of self-medication variables with demographic factors. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The present study was a community based cross sectional study aimed to gather information about the prevalence of self-medication in the rural town of Sahaswan, Uttar Pradesh from June 2012 to July 2012. The sample size comprised of 600 respondents. Data were collected through a prepared questionnaire. All descriptive data were coded, entered and analyzed using the statistical package for Social sciences program version 17.0 (Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive data analysis was conducted and reported as frequencies and percentage. RESULTS: The percentage of patients who were seeking self-medication was approximately 50% (300/600). Most of the patients were seeking self-medication for headache and other pain (23.3% [140/600]), fever (14.5% [87/600]), urinary tract infections (9.7% [58/600]) and respiratory tract infections (11.7% [70/600]). The drugs most commonly purchased for practicing self-medication were non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (25.3% [152/600]), medications used for gastro intestinal problems (20.8% [125/600]) and antibiotics (16.7% [100/600]). CONCLUSION: Prevalence of self-medication was high primarily among illiterate males aged above 15 years with a low income. Patient health awareness programs, assistance by community pharmacists and pharmacist continuing education are necessary for controlling self-medication. There is a need for planning interventions to promote rational self-medication through mass medias such as newspaper, magazine and TV.",

Low-dose SoluMatrix(R) diclofenac has been developed to provide efficacy at lower diclofenac doses. A recently published Phase III study evaluated the efficacy and safety of SoluMatrix diclofenac 35 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) and thrice daily (t.i.d.) in patients with OA pain treated for 12 weeks. METHODS: This Phase III multicenter, open-label study assessed the safety of SoluMatrix diclofenac in patients with OA dosed up to 52 weeks (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01510912). The study enrolled 602 chronic NSAID/acetaminophen users, aged >/=40 years with OA of the knee or hip. Patients received SoluMatrix diclofenac 35 mg b.i.d., which could be increased to t.i.d. and subsequently reduced to b.i.d. as needed. Safety assessments included AEs, vital signs, physical examination findings, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and clinical laboratory test results. Patient-reported outcomes were evaluated by the Short Form-36 (SF-36). RESULTS: A total of 601 patients received SoluMatrix diclofenac; 373 of 601 patients (62.1%) received treatment for >/=11 months. The most frequent AEs included upper respiratory tract infection, headache, urinary tract infection, diarrhea, nasopharyngitis, and nausea. Serious gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal, and hepatic AEs were uncommon. A small proportion (99 patients, 16.5%) of patients discontinued participation in the study due to AEs. Clinically meaningful improvements from baseline in Physical Component Summary Scores of the SF-36 were noted at week 12 and were sustained through week 52. Improvements in six of the eight individual physical and mental SF-36 domains were also noted. CONCLUSION: SoluMatrix diclofenac treatment for up to 1 year was generally well tolerated in patients with OA pain and associated with improvement in quality of life measures.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted among 300 patients reporting to the People's College of Dental Sciences and Research Centre, Bhopal, India. Only patients >/= 18 years of age were included and consenting participants anonymously completed the questionnaire, with incomplete questionnaires being excluded from the study. The semi-structured questionnaire containing both open- and closedended questions was prepared in the local language and included demographic data, name of self-medication, frequency of self-medication, periods of illness, duration, dose, frequency of drug administration, symptoms for which drugs were used, satisfaction with healthcare facilities, source of information for self-medication, presence of chronic illness, adverse effects to self-medication seen in patients and drug interactions. The unpaired t-test and chi-square test were used for statistical analysis. p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A significant association was seen between education and self-medication. It was observed that the subjects who fell ill more frequently consumed medications on their own more often. Medications were most commonly taken for cough, cold and fever. The most preferred medicine was paracetamol. Most of the subjects found the medicines effective in helping them relieve their symptoms. However, not even half of the subjects were aware of the dose, duration, side-effects or interactions of medicines. There was a significant association between knowledge about side-effects and side-effects experienced from medication. A significant association was also seen between knowledge about side-effects and frequency of self-medication. CONCLUSION: Self-medication and non-doctor prescribing are relatively common in Bhopal. Knowledge regarding the appropriate usage of medication is inadequate. Education to help patients decide on the appropriateness of selfmedication is required.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients admitted with acute tonsillitis generate a substantial workload for the National Health Service (NHS), placing huge financial pressures on an already overstretched budget. OBJECTIVE OF REVIEW: Due to the difficulty of accurate diagnosis and varying practices across the UK, there exist a number of controversial areas and non-standardised practice. These will be highlighted and tackled within this article. TYPE OF REVIEW AND SEARCH STRATEGY: A literature review, last performed in September 2013, searched PubMed citing variations on the areas of controversies with 'tonsillitis', 'pharyngitis' and 'pharyngotonsillitis' - from 1956 to present with language restrictions. Excluded articles included those regarding sore throat after tonsillectomy and peritonsillar abscess. EVALUATION METHOD: Titles and abstracts were initially screened, and full text of potentially relevant articles obtained. The bibliographies of articles were searched for relevant references. The references were then compiled and reviewed independently by two authors (JB & TB), overseen by the senior author (EK). RESULTS: (i) Diagnosis and investigation: Use of the Centor criteria is inadequate within the secondary care setting. Blood testing is unnecessary in the majority of cases where patients do not require admission, as they are unlikely to change management. (ii) Antibiotics: Antibiotics are likely to be indicated in all those presenting to secondary ENT care, with penicillin being the antibiotic of choice for first-line therapy. (iii) Corticosteroids: Moderate evidence supports the benefit of steroid administration in this patient cohort, advocating a single dose initially followed by reassessment. (iv) Analgesia: Paracetamol and NSAIDs have good evidence of action. Codeine should be used with caution in the paediatric population. (v) Reduced admission rates and early discharge: There is evidence suggesting that a trial of medical therapy prior to admission is beneficial in reducing rates of admission and length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Management of acute tonsillitis within a secondary care setting largely consists of anecdotal or relatively low-quality evidence. Thus, much evidence from management comes from expert opinion or practice within a primary care setting. Management across the UK can also vary greatly. An evidence-based review of best practice has been presented here, but further evidence will be required in the future examining the significance of corticosteroids and antibiotic administration in this patient cohort specifically, ensuring practice is evidence based and clinically relevant.",

The aim here was to evaluate the response to therapy for these attacks using icatibant, an inhibitor of the bradykinin receptor, which was recently introduced into Brazil. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective experimental single-cohort study on the efficacy and safety of icatibant for HAE patients. METHODS: Patients with a confirmed HAE diagnosis were enrolled according to symptoms and regardless of the time since onset of the attack. Icatibant was administered in accordance with the protocol that has been approved in Brazil. Symptom severity was assessed continuously and adverse events were monitored. RESULTS: 24 attacks in 20 HAE patients were treated (female/male 19:1; 19-55 years; median 29 years of age). The symptoms were: subcutaneous edema (22/24); abdominal pain (15/24) and upper airway obstruction (10/24). The time taken until onset of relief was: 5-10 minutes (5/24; 20.8%); 10-20 (5/24; 20.8%); 20-30 (8/24; 33.4%); 30-60 (5/24; 20.8%); and 2 hours (1/24; 4.3%). The time taken for complete resolution of symptoms ranged from 4.3 to 33.4 hours. Adverse effects were only reported at injection sites. Mild to moderate erythema and/or feelings of burning were reported by 15/24 patients, itching by 3 and no adverse effects in 6. CONCLUSION: HAE type I patients who received icatibant responded promptly; most achieved improved symptom severity within 30 minutes. Local adverse events occurred in 75% of the patients.",

OBJECTIVE: This article summarizes the Italian guidelines on the management of pharyngitis in children issued by the National Institute of Health. METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of experts (the Guidelines Development Group) developed and used a set of key questions to conduct a systematic review of the literature. Relevant publications in English were identified through a systematic review of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from their inception through April 30, 2011. Final recommendations were scaled according to the Italian National Guidelines Program grading. RESULTS: Eighteen clinical questions were defined, and 44 recommendations were issued. None of the available scoring systems is sufficiently accurate to identify group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) pharyngitis in settings with low prevalence for rheumatic disease. RADT should be performed by trained personnel in every child with a history and signs/symptoms suggestive of GABHS pharyngitis. RADT is not recommended in children with a McIsaac score of 0 or 1 with >/=2 signs/symptoms suggestive of viral infection. Backup culture in children with negative RADT result is not recommended. Culture test with antibiotic susceptibility assay should be performed exclusively for epidemiologic purposes. Streptococcal antibody titers are of no value in diagnosing acute pharyngitis. Antibiotic therapy is recommended in microbiologically documented GABHS pharyngitis. Because penicillin V is not available in Italy, amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/d in 2-3 doses orally) for 10 days is the first choice of treatment. In noncompliant cases, benzathine penicillin may be administered. Although not routinely recommended due to the high cost and wide spectrum of activity, a 5-day course with a second-generation cephalosporin may be used in noncompliant cases. Macrolides should be limited to children with demonstrated type I hypersensitivity to penicillin. Ibuprofen or paracetamol is recommended for relief of pain or fever associated with discomfort. Because the carrier state is not associated with increased risk of suppurative complications and risk of GABHS transmission to contacts is minimal, the carrier state should never be investigated and treated. Recommendations for the management of suppurative complications are given.

A recent genome-wide association study identified the gene encoding the centrosomal protein of 68 KDa (CEP68) as the major locus associated with aspirin intolerance susceptibility in asthmatics. In this study, we aimed to assess the role of this locus in susceptibility to CRI to NSAIDs by examining 53 common gene variants in a total of 635 patients that were classified as MNSAID-UA (n = 399), airway exacerbations (n = 110) or blended pattern (n = 126), and 425 controls. We found in the MNSAID-UA group a number of variants (17) associated (lowest p-value = 1.13 x 10(-6)), including the non-synonymous Gly74Ser variant (rs7572857) previously associated with aspirin intolerance susceptibility in asthmatics. Although not being significant in the context of multiple testing, eight of these variants were also associated with exacerbated respiratory disease or blended reactions. Our results suggest that CEP68 gene variants may play an important role in MNSAID-UA susceptibility and, despite the different regulatory mechanisms involved depending on the specific affected organ, in the development of hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs.",

METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, parallel group study was conducted at six community-based clinical research centres in Australia and two in New Zealand.

The primary endpoint was the area under the change from baseline curve in throat soreness from zero-two hours (AUC0-2h). The change from baseline in other sore throat symptoms also assessed efficacy. RESULTS: The mean AUC0-2h for throat soreness was significantly greater with flurbiprofen spray (-1.82; 95% CI: -1.98 to 1.65) compared with placebo (-1.13; 95% CI: -1.27 to 0.99) (P < 0.0001).

The objectives of our study were to assess the prevalence of anterior chest wall pain and to describe its clinical characteristics in a cohort of spondyloarthritis patients in a tertiary care center. METHODS: STUDY DESIGN: retrolective single center observational study in 2010 (COSPA). Consecutive patients with definite spondyloarthritis according to Amor's criteria were included. DATA COLLECTION: each patient underwent direct interview by a physician. Prevalence of anterior chest wall pain, according to spondyloarthritis subtype and its date of appearance, localization and nature were collected. RESULTS: In all, 275 consecutive spondyloarthritis patients were assessed. Among them, 102 patients (37.1%) suffered from spondyloarthritis-associated anterior chest wall pain. It was the first symptom of spondyloarthritis in 3.6% of cases. The prevalence after 5 and 10 years following the diagnosis of spondyloarthritis was 26.0% and 35.5%, respectively. Pain was usually in the upper chest and acute, increased by respiratory movements and movements of the arm; pain during the night was less frequent (41.0%).

The objectives of our study were to assess the prevalence of anterior chest wall pain and to describe its clinical characteristics in a cohort of spondyloarthritis patients in a tertiary care center. METHODS: STUDY DESIGN: retrolective single center observational study in 2010 (COSPA). Consecutive patients with definite spondyloarthritis according to Amor's criteria were included. DATA COLLECTION: each patient underwent direct interview by a physician. Prevalence of anterior chest wall pain, according to spondyloarthritis subtype and its date of appearance, localization and nature were collected. RESULTS: In all, 275 consecutive spondyloarthritis patients were assessed. Among them, 102 patients (37.1%) suffered from spondyloarthritis-associated anterior chest wall pain. It was the first symptom of spondyloarthritis in 3.6% of cases. The prevalence after 5 and 10 years following the diagnosis of spondyloarthritis was 26.0% and 35.5%, respectively. Pain was usually in the upper chest and acute, increased by respiratory movements and movements of the arm; pain during the night was less frequent (41.0%). A flare lasted on average 5 weeks; recurrences were frequent (75%). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anti-tumor necrosis factor agents were reported as effective in 49.3% and 80.0% of cases, respectively.

Safety studies with large sample sizes have not been published as yet. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of metamizole in children aged up to 6 years undergoing surgery with a particular focus on serious ADRs such as haemodynamic, anaphylactic or respiratory reactions and agranulocytosis. DESIGN: A multicentre, prospective, noninterventional, observational postauthorisation safety study (PASS). SETTING: The study was conducted in six different paediatric centres from September 2013 to September 2014. PATIENTS: One thousand one hundred and seventy-seven children aged up to six years (American Society of Anesthesiologists' physical status class I to III) receiving a single dose of metamizole for postoperative pain therapy were enrolled. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient demographics, main and secondary diagnoses, surgical procedures performed, metamizole dose, haemodynamic data, use of other analgesics and regional blocks, results of pain measurement (Children and Infants Postoperative Pain Scale, ChIPPS) and ADR incidence were documented using a standardised case report form. RESULTS: Of the 1177 children observed at six paediatric centres, 1145 were included for analysis [age 35.8 +/- 18.1 (0.1 to 72) months]. The mean metamizole dose was 17.3 +/- 2.9 (8.3 to 29.4) mg kg(-1). Mean arterial pressure (MAP) remained stable during metamizole infusion [baseline 55.7 +/- 1.3 (25 to 98) and after infusion 56.6 +/- 11.3 (25 to 99) mmHg; P < 0.01]. Pruritus, swelling and exanthema were observed in one patient each (total 0.3%). No respiratory adverse events directly related to the metamizole administration and no clinical signs of agranulocytosis were reported. All data are mean +/- SD (range). CONCLUSION: Single intravenous doses of metamizole used for the prevention or treatment of postoperative pain were well tolerated in more than 1000 children aged up to 6 years. The probability of serious ADRs (haemodynamic, anaphylactic or respiratory reactions) is lower than 0.3%. The sample size and follow-up was not sufficient to detect episodes of agranulocytosis.",

METHODS: A single cohort, single treatment arm, open-label study. Subjects received one 30 mL dose of syrup containing IFF Flavour 316282, paracetamol and pseudoephedrine and recorded onset and disappearance of any warming sensation in the mouth/throat. Subjects' assessments of strength and appeal of the sensation, taste, texture and acceptability of the product was investigated using questionnaires. RESULTS: A total of 56 subjects were included; 53 (94.6%) experienced a warming sensation. The median duration of the warming sensation was 114 s (95% confidence interval: 87-120 s). All subjects rated the syrup as excellent, good or fair for treating their symptoms; 100% and 94.6% of subjects respectively described texture and taste as excellent, good or fair.

Subjects received one 30 mL dose of syrup containing IFF Flavour 316282, paracetamol and pseudoephedrine and recorded onset and disappearance of any warming sensation in the mouth/throat. Subjects' assessments of strength and appeal of the sensation, taste, texture and acceptability of the product was investigated using questionnaires. RESULTS: A total of 56 subjects were included; 53 (94.6%) experienced a warming sensation. The median duration of the warming sensation was 114 s (95% confidence interval: 87-120 s). All subjects rated the syrup as excellent, good or fair for treating their symptoms; 100% and 94.6% of subjects respectively described texture and taste as excellent, good or fair. There were no safety concerns, and the syrup was well tolerated. Most subjects liked the warming sensation. CONCLUSIONS: IFF Flavour 316282 in a syrup for treatment of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms is associated with a warming sensation. The syrup is well tolerated, safe and palatable.",

CASE SUMMARY: A 58-year-old male with recurrent otitis media was admitted for left lateral hip pain of 10 on a scale of 10. He had started a 5-day course of levofloxacin 750 mg/day 10 days before he began experiencing pain. He also took simvastatin 20 mg/day and walked 90 minutes each day. He was treated with oxycodone with acetaminophen and physical therapy. His pain had improved significantly at a 10-day recheck. DISCUSSION: Fluoroquinolone-induced tendinopathy has been well-reported in the literature, but most cases involve pefloxacin and affect the Achilles tendon. Only 11 cases of tendinopathy have been reported with levofloxacin based on a MEDLINE search (1966-December 2011). This is the first known case reported that involved tendinopathy of the hip believed to be caused by fluoroquinolones. The Naranjo probability scale revealed a possible adverse reaction of levofloxacin-induced tendinopathy of the hip. Contributing factors likely included the high dose of levofloxacin, concomitant use of a statin, and strenuous physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Health care professionals should be aware of the possibility of tendinopathy of the hip in patients who receive fluoroquinolones. Thorough history for possible risk factors should be obtained. Patients on fluoroquinolones at risk for tendinopathy should be counseled to avoid strenuous physical activity.",

Chest X-ray revealed a pleural effusion, assumed to be caused by cardiac failure and respiratory infection. Despite treatment with antibiotics and diuretics, the pleural effusion increased on chest X-ray and there were signs of pleural and pericardial effusion on computed tomography (CT) scan. Treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was not successful. Meanwhile patients' long-term use of ergotamine for migraine was revealed, which is associated with pleuropulmonary and cardiac fibrotic reactions. Tentative treatment with colchicine was successful, with complete resolution of pleural fluid, fever, cough and inflammatory parameters. This case highlights the importance of establishing an ergot alkaloid use registry in unexplained pleuropericardial effusions and supports the use of colchicine as a potential therapeutic approach.",

		"abstract": "A 83-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with chest pain, fever, dry cough and palpitations. Chest X-ray revealed a pleural effusion, assumed to be caused by cardiac failure and respiratory infection. Despite treatment with antibiotics and diuretics, the pleural effusion increased on chest X-ray and there were signs of pleural and pericardial effusion on computed tomography (CT) scan. Treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was not successful. Meanwhile patients' long-term use of ergotamine for migraine was revealed, which is associated with pleuropulmonary and cardiac fibrotic reactions. Tentative treatment with colchicine was successful, with complete resolution of pleural fluid, fever, cough and inflammatory parameters. This case highlights the importance of establishing an ergot alkaloid use registry in unexplained pleuropericardial effusions and supports the use of colchicine as a potential therapeutic approach.",

It is widely recognized that the resolution of inflammation is an active process, governed by specialized proresolving lipid mediators, including lipoxins, resolvins, maresins, and protectins. Here, we report that proresolving signaling and metabolic pathways are disrupted in lung tissue from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, suggesting that supplementation with proresolving lipid mediators might reduce the development of emphysema by controlling chronic inflammation. Groups of mice were exposed long-term to cigarette smoke and treated with the proresolving mediator resolvin D1. Resolvin D1 was associated with a reduced development of cigarette smoke-induced emphysema and airspace enlargement, with concurrent reductions in inflammation, oxidative stress, and cell death. Interestingly, resolvin D1 did not promote the differentiation of M2 macrophages and did not promote tissue fibrosis. Taken together, our results suggest that cigarette smoking disrupts endogenous proresolving pathways and that supplementation with specialized proresolving lipid mediators is an important therapeutic strategy in chronic lung disease, especially if endogenous specialized proresolving lipid mediator signaling is impaired.",

Parecoxib is the only parenterally administered selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor widely used in acute pain control. The purpose of this study is to assess the analgesic effects of parecoxib compared with morphine for postoperative sore throat in patients undergoing laryngeal microsurgery. Fifty patients were randomly allocated to receive either parecoxib 0.5 mg/kg or morphine 50 mug/kg prior to anesthesia induction. General anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 2-4%. Postoperative sore throat and other outcomes were measured at a postanesthesia care unit (PACU) 4 hours and 24 hours postoperatively. The severity of postoperative sore throat was assessed by sore throat score as follows: none (0) = no pharyngeal or laryngeal discomfort; mild (1) = no pain at rest, but swallowing induced mild pain or discomfort; moderate (2) = constant pain without swallowing exacerbation; and severe (3) = constant pain with swallowing or respiratory exacerbation. The incidences of postoperative side effects (nausea, vomiting, itching, dizziness, and somnolence) were also recorded. Demographic data from the parecoxib (n = 25) and morphine (n = 25) groups did not differ significantly. The parecoxib group depicted similar sore throat scores as the morphine group at three measured postoperative time points. Patients requiring postoperative analgesics were comparable between the parecoxib group and morphine group (2/25, 8% vs. 3/25, 12%, p = 0.64). Overall postoperative adverse events were fewer in the parecoxib group than the morphine group (3/25, 12% vs. 9/25, 36%, p = 0.047). Both parecoxib and morphine are effective to attenuate postoperative sore throat after laryngeal microsurgery.

ASA challenge is the gold standard for diagnosing AERD (Curr Allergy Asthma 9:155-163, 2009). The practice of ASA challenge and desensitization in Canada is infrequently utilized, which may explain its omission as a viable therapeutic option in the latest Canadian clinical practice guidelines for acute and chronic rhinosinusitis (AACI 7:1-38, 2011). METHODS: This retrospective study assessed 111 patients who underwent ASA desensitization in the Allergy and Immunology clinic at St. Joseph's Healthcare (SJHC) in London, Ontario. The mean age was 50.7 years, and 52.5% (n = 58) were male. Sixty-one percent (n = 68) claimed prior, significant reactions to ASA, and all patients had features of AERD. RESULTS: Seventy-three percent (n = 81) claimed symptom improvement after achieving maintenance dosing on the desensitization protocol. Of this population, 21.6% (n = 24) improved in all 3 areas of interest (sense of taste or smell, upper respiratory symptoms and lower respiratory symptoms). Twenty-six percent (n = 29) had adverse effects, mostly in the way of gastrointestinal upset, but no severe adverse events were seen. CONCLUSIONS: ASA desensitization helps improve symptoms in patients with AERD. Further, it allows patients to tolerate additional ASA and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) when needed for supplemental analgesia or for cardio-protection. This is of particular benefit in those who require these medications for improved quality of life, and for reduced morbidity and mortality, such as those with cardiovascular disease or chronic pain. There should be further studies conducted in Canada as well as consideration for ASA desensitization to be included in the next clinical practice guidelines.",

Of this population, 21.6% (n = 24) improved in all 3 areas of interest (sense of taste or smell, upper respiratory symptoms and lower respiratory symptoms). Twenty-six percent (n = 29) had adverse effects, mostly in the way of gastrointestinal upset, but no severe adverse events were seen. CONCLUSIONS: ASA desensitization helps improve symptoms in patients with AERD. Further, it allows patients to tolerate additional ASA and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) when needed for supplemental analgesia or for cardio-protection. This is of particular benefit in those who require these medications for improved quality of life, and for reduced morbidity and mortality, such as those with cardiovascular disease or chronic pain. There should be further studies conducted in Canada as well as consideration for ASA desensitization to be included in the next clinical practice guidelines.",

Pateclizumab (anti-lymphotoxin- alpha; MLTA3698A) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks and depletes anti-LTalpha. This phase 2, randomized, head-to-head, active- and placebo-controlled trial examined the safety and efficacy of pateclizumab compared to adalimumab in RA patients with an inadequate response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD-IR). METHODS: Patients (n = 214) with active RA (>/= 6 swollen and tender joints, C-reactive protein >/= 10 mg/L) on oral DMARDs were randomized (2:2:1) to receive pateclizumab 360 mg, adalimumab 40 mg, or placebo subcutaneously every 2 weeks. The primary endpoint, 4-variable, 28-joint disease activity score erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28(4)-ESR) response, was evaluated at 12 weeks using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with adjustments for concomitant DMARD use and geographic region. Secondary efficacy endpoints included American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20, ACR50, and ACR70 responses at Day 85. Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity of pateclizumab were assessed. RESULTS: Pateclizumab reduced the DAS28(4)-ESR response (-1.89) at 12 weeks, however, this did not reach statistical significance compared to placebo (-1.54), while adalimumab (-2.52) differed significantly from both placebo and pateclizumab. Pateclizumab 12-week ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 response rates (64%, 33%, and 14%) suggested clinical activity but were not statistically significant compared to placebo rates (46%, 24%, and 8%, respectively). CXCL13 serum levels decreased significantly following pateclizumab and adalimumab administration, demonstrating pharmacological target engagement by both drugs. Overall, adverse events (AEs) were comparable among all cohorts. Infections were the most common AE, occurring with comparable frequency in all groups. Serious AEs occurred in 0% of pateclizumab, 5.9% of adalimumab, and 2.3% of placebo patients, with serious infection in 2.3% of adalimumab patients and none in pateclizumab and placebo patients. CONCLUSIONS: Pateclizumab had a good safety profile in patients inadequately responsive to DMARDs, but no statistically significant improvement in RA signs and symptoms after 12 weeks of treatment. Adalimumab demonstrated efficacy and safety comparable to published results in this head-to-head comparison in DMARD-IR RA patients.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of NSAIDs versus placebo (and other treatments) on signs and symptoms of the common cold, and to determine any adverse effects of NSAIDs in people with the common cold. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1966 to April week 4, 2013), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2013), CINAHL (January 1982 to April 2013) and ProQuest Digital Dissertations (January 1938 to April 2013). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of NSAIDS in adults or children with the common cold. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four review authors extracted data. We subdivided trials into placebo-controlled RCTs and head-to-head comparisons of NSAIDs. We extracted and summarised data on global efficacies of analgesic effects (such as reduction of headache and myalgia), non-analgesic effects (such as reduction of nasal symptoms, cough, sputum and sneezing) and side effects. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous data as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD). We pooled data using the fixed- and random-effects models. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine RCTs with 1069 participants, describing 37 comparisons: six were NSAIDs versus placebo and three were NSAIDs versus NSAIDs. The overall risk of bias in the included studies was mixed. In a pooled analysis, NSAIDs did not significantly reduce the total symptom score (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -1.03 to 0.24, three studies, random-effects model), or duration of colds (MD -0.23, 95% CI -1.75 to 1.29, two studies, random-effects model). For respiratory symptoms, cough did not improve (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.66 to 0.56, two studies, random-effects model) but the sneezing score significantly improved (SMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.12, two studies, random-effects model). For outcomes related to the analgesic effects of NSAIDs (headache, ear pain, and muscle and joint pain) the treatment produced significant benefits. The risk of adverse effects was not high with NSAIDs (RR 2.94, 95% CI 0.51 to 17.03, two studies, random-effects model) and it is difficult to conclude that such drugs are not different from placebo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: NSAIDs are somewhat effective in relieving discomfort caused by a cold but there is no clear evidence of their effect in easing respiratory symptoms.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of NSAIDs versus placebo (and other treatments) on signs and symptoms of the common cold, and to determine any adverse effects of NSAIDs in people with the common cold. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (2015, Issue 4, April), (January 1966 to April week 3, 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to April 2015), CINAHL (January 1982 to April 2015) and ProQuest Digital Dissertations (January 1938 to April 2015). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of NSAIDS in adults or children with the common cold. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Four review authors extracted data. We subdivided trials into placebo-controlled RCTs and head-to-head comparisons of NSAIDs. We extracted and summarised data on global analgesic effects (such as reduction of headache and myalgia), non-analgesic effects (such as reduction of nasal symptoms, cough, sputum and sneezing) and side effects. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous data as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD). We pooled data using the fixed-effect and random-effects models. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine RCTs with 1069 participants, describing 37 comparisons: six were NSAIDs versus placebo and three were NSAIDs versus NSAIDs. The overall risk of bias in the included studies was mixed. In a pooled analysis, NSAIDs did not significantly reduce the total symptom score (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -1.03 to 0.24, three studies, random-effects model), or duration of colds (MD -0.23, 95% CI -1.75 to 1.29, two studies, random-effects model). For respiratory symptoms, cough did not improve (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.66 to 0.56, two studies, random-effects model) but the sneezing score significantly improved (SMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.12, two studies, random-effects model). For outcomes related to the analgesic effects of NSAIDs (headache, ear pain, and muscle and joint pain) the treatment produced significant benefits. The risk of adverse effects was not high with NSAIDs (RR 2.94, 95% CI 0.51 to 17.03, two studies, random-effects model) but it is difficult to conclude that such drugs are no different from placebo. The quality of the evidence may be estimated as 'moderate' because of imprecision. The major limitations of this review are that the results of the studies are quite diverse and the number of studies for one result is quite small. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: NSAIDs are somewhat effective in relieving the discomfort caused by a cold but there is no clear evidence of their effect in easing respiratory symptoms. The balance of benefit and harms needs to be considered when using NSAIDs for colds.",

Differentiating myopericarditis from acute coronary syndromes can be challenging and may require coronary angiography or perfusion studies. Data on myopericarditis and its outcome for children are scarce. This study delineates the demography, clinical presentation, and outcomes of myopericarditis for children and evaluates the prognostic value of elevated troponin I. The authors retrospectively reviewed 880 patients younger than 18 years of age who were admitted with diagnoses of chest pain, myocarditis, or pericarditis between 2000 and 2010 at their institution. Myopericarditis was defined as a clinical presentation of pericarditis in the presence of elevated levels of cardiac enzymes. Medical records were reviewed to abstract the demographic data, clinical presentation, evaluation, treatment, and follow-up outcomes. A total of 12 patients (1.4%) with myopericarditis were identified. All the patients were male, 8 (67%) of whom were Caucasian, and their median age was 16 years (range, 11-17 years). Two of the patients (17%) had recently used illicit drugs, and two (17%) had recently smoked cigarettes. At presentation, symptoms included chest pain in 12 patients (100%, 12/12), upper respiratory symptoms in 3 patients (25%, 3/12), and shortness of breath in 3 patients (25%, 3/12). No cardiac murmur or gallop was noted in any patient. Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes included diffuse ST-T changes (5 patients), localized ST-T changes (6 patients), and no ST-T changes (1 patient). All the patients had elevated levels of cardiac enzymes, with a median Troponin I level of 21.4 ng/ml (range, 5.0-134.4 ng/ml) and a median CK-MB level of 50.2 ng/ml (range, 7-135 ng/ml). Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular systolic function in all the patients (median ejection fraction, 61%; range, 56-69%). None had pericardial effusion during the first echocardiographic evaluation. Coronary angiography showed normal coronary arteries in all nine subjects for whom it was performed. Treatment of myopericarditis consisted of ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and/or aspirin. During a median follow-up period of 2 months (range, 2 weeks to 3 years), all the patients were asymptomatic with echocardiography showing normal left ventricular size and function. Myopericarditis was exclusively seen in male adolescents. Despite markedly elevated levels of cardiac enzymes, the clinical evolution of myopericarditis seems benign without any myocardial dysfunction. The inflammatory involvement of the myocardium appears to be self-limited without short-term, overt sequelae. An elevated troponin I level in myopericarditis, unlike acute coronary syndromes, does not seem to carry an adverse prognosis. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term prognosis for such patients.",

METHODS: Subjects were evaluated at baseline and at week 12 following routine treatment for CP/CPPS using the Korean version of the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) to measure the severity of CP/CPPS; the Korean version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to assess depression; the Korean version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) to evaluate somatization; and the Korean version of the EuroQol Questionnaire-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), specifically the EQ-5D utility index and the EQ-5D visual analog scale (EQ-5D VAS), to assess quality of life (QoL). Personality traits including extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness were determined at baseline using the 44-item Big Five Inventory (BFI). The influence of personality traits on the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with CP/CPPS was assessed using relevant statistical analyses. RESULTS: Neuroticism was associated with a significantly poorer treatment response and higher levels of depression and somatization. Extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness had some influence on clinical characteristics but openness did not affect overall symptoms or the treatment response in patients with CP/CPPS. CONCLUSIONS: We found that neuroticism may be the most important personality trait associated with treatment response and the severity of depression and somatization in patients with CP/CPPS. However, our exploratory findings should be confirmed by additional studies with adequate power and improved designs.",

According to the patient, the complaints were controlled partially with nasal steroid and antihistamines, and single dose parenteral depot steroids were highly effective in controlling the symptoms and each time this effect lasted at least three weeks. The patient was told to use aspirin when needed analgesic and he started to use aspirin 500 mg bid. po for 10 days for his pain in the joints. The patient stressed the superiority of aspirin over other drugs including oral antihistamine and LTA and its equality to systemic steroid drugs in suppressing symptoms. It seemed that aspirin had positive effects in allergic inflammation at least in some subset of aspirin tolerant patients with chronic sinusitis.",

Research data suggest that acetaminophen is a hormone disruptor, and abnormal hormonal exposures in pregnancy may influence fetal brain development. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether prenatal exposure to acetaminophen increases the risk for developing attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)-like behavioral problems or hyperkinetic disorders (HKDs) in children. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We studied 64,322 live-born children and mothers enrolled in the Danish National Birth Cohort during 1996-2002. EXPOSURES: Acetaminophen use during pregnancy was assessed prospectively via 3 computer-assisted telephone interviews during pregnancy and 6 months after child birth. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: To ascertain outcome information we used (1) parental reports of behavioral problems in children 7 years of age using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; (2) retrieved HKD diagnoses from the Danish National Hospital Registry or the Danish Psychiatric Central Registry prior to 2011; and (3) identified ADHD prescriptions (mainly Ritalin) for children from the Danish Prescription Registry. We estimated hazard ratios for receiving an HKD diagnosis or using ADHD medications and risk ratios for behavioral problems in children after prenatal exposure to acetaminophen. RESULTS: More than half of all mothers reported acetaminophen use while pregnant. Children whose mothers used acetaminophen during pregnancy were at higher risk for receiving a hospital diagnosis of HKD (hazard ratio = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.19-1.59), use of ADHD medications (hazard ratio = 1.29; 95% CI, 1.15-1.44), or having ADHD-like behaviors at age 7 years (risk ratio = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27). Stronger associations were observed with use in more than 1 trimester during pregnancy, and exposure response trends were found with increasing frequency of acetaminophen use during gestation for all outcomes (ie, HKD diagnosis, ADHD medication use, and ADHD-like behaviors; P trend < .001). Results did not appear to be confounded by maternal inflammation, infection during pregnancy, the mother's mental health problems, or other potential confounders we evaluated. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Maternal acetaminophen use during pregnancy is associated with a higher risk for HKDs and ADHD-like behaviors in children. Because the exposure and outcome are frequent, these results are of public health relevance but further investigations are needed.",

METHODS: The possible anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects were assayed on carrageenan-induced paw oedema and pleurisy, acetic acid-induced abdominal writhing and formalin tests in mice. KEY FINDINGS: LQFM-015 reduced the activity of PLA(2) enzyme in vitro by 18%. Docking studies into the catalytic site of PLA(2) were used to identify the binding mode of the LQFM-015. LQFM-015 showed a moderate antinociceptive effect, since this compound reduced the number of writhings by approximately up to 40% in the acetic acid-induced pain model; this antinociceptive activity also emerged in the second phase of the formalin-induced pain model (58% of inhibition). The anti-inflammatory action of LQFM-015 was confirmed in acute inflammation models, in which it reduced the formation of oedema to 52.78 +/- 8.6 and 46.64 +/- 5.2 at the second and third hour of carrageenan-induced paw oedema, respectively. Also in the carrageenan-induced pleurisy model, LQFM-015 reduced the migration of leucocytes by 26.0% and decrease myeloperoxidase activity by 50%. LQFM-015 showed different concentrations to inhibit 50% of isoenzyme cyclooxygenase activity (IC50); COX-1 IC50 = 36 muM) and COX-2 IC50 = 28 muM. CONCLUSIONS: LQFM-015 demonstrated inhibition of both PLA(2) and COX enzymes; thus, the moderate antinociceptive effect of this compound could be attributed to its anti-inflammatory activity.",

DESIGN: Open pragmatic parallel group factorial randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Primary care in United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged >/= 3 with acute respiratory tract infections. INTERVENTION: 889 patients were randomised with computer generated random numbers in pre-prepared sealed numbered envelopes to components of advice or comparator advice: advice on analgesia (take paracetamol, ibuprofen, or both), dosing of analgesia (take as required v regularly), and steam inhalation (no inhalation v steam inhalation). OUTCOMES: Primary: mean symptom severity on days 2-4; symptoms rated 0 (no problem) to 7 (as bad as it can be). Secondary: temperature, antibiotic use, reconsultations. RESULTS: Neither advice on dosing nor on steam inhalation was significantly associated with changes in outcomes. Compared with paracetamol, symptom severity was little different with ibuprofen (adjusted difference 0.04, 95% confidence interval -0.11 to 0.19) or the combination of ibuprofen and paracetamol (0.11, -0.04 to 0.26). There was no evidence for selective benefit with ibuprofen among most subgroups defined before analysis (presence of otalgia; previous duration of symptoms; temperature >37.5 degrees C; severe symptoms), but there was evidence of reduced symptoms severity benefit in the subgroup with chest infections (ibuprofen -0.40, -0.78 to -0.01; combination -0.47; -0.84 to -0.10), equivalent to almost one in two symptoms rated as a slight rather than a moderately bad problem. Children might also benefit from treatment with ibuprofen (ibuprofen: -0.47, -0.76 to -0.18; combination: -0.04, -0.31 to 0.23). Reconsultations with new/unresolved symptoms or complications were documented in 12% of those advised to take paracetamol, 20% of those advised to take ibuprofen (adjusted risk ratio 1.67, 1.12 to 2.38), and 17% of those advised to take the combination (1.49, 0.98 to 2.18). Mild thermal injury with steam was documented for four patients (2%) who returned full diaries, but no reconsultations with scalding were documented. CONCLUSION: Overall advice to use steam inhalation, or ibuprofen rather than paracetamol, does not help control symptoms in patients with acute respiratory tract infections and must be balanced against the possible progression of symptoms during the next month for a minority of patients. Advice to use ibuprofen might help short term control of symptoms in those with chest infections and in children. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN 38551726.",

DESIGN: Open pragmatic parallel group factorial randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Primary care in United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged >/= 3 with acute respiratory tract infections. INTERVENTION: 889 patients were randomised with computer generated random numbers in pre-prepared sealed numbered envelopes to components of advice or comparator advice: advice on analgesia (take paracetamol, ibuprofen, or both), dosing of analgesia (take as required v regularly), and steam inhalation (no inhalation v steam inhalation). OUTCOMES: Primary: mean symptom severity on days 2-4; symptoms rated 0 (no problem) to 7 (as bad as it can be). Secondary: temperature, antibiotic use, reconsultations. RESULTS: Neither advice on dosing nor on steam inhalation was significantly associated with changes in outcomes. Compared with paracetamol, symptom severity was little different with ibuprofen (adjusted difference 0.04, 95% confidence interval -0.11 to 0.19) or the combination of ibuprofen and paracetamol (0.11, -0.04 to 0.26). There was no evidence for selective benefit with ibuprofen among most subgroups defined before analysis (presence of otalgia; previous duration of symptoms; temperature >37.5 degrees C; severe symptoms), but there was evidence of reduced symptoms severity benefit in the subgroup with chest infections (ibuprofen -0.40, -0.78 to -0.01; combination -0.47; -0.84 to -0.10), equivalent to almost one in two symptoms rated as a slight rather than a moderately bad problem. Children might also benefit from treatment with ibuprofen (ibuprofen: -0.47, -0.76 to -0.18; combination: -0.04, -0.31 to 0.23). Reconsultations with new/unresolved symptoms or complications were documented in 12% of those advised to take paracetamol, 20% of those advised to take ibuprofen (adjusted risk ratio 1.67, 1.12 to 2.38), and 17% of those advised to take the combination (1.49, 0.98 to 2.18).

METHODS: We retrospectively studied pain in 206 children above 7 years of age undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy from December 2011 to February 2012 at our institution. We extracted data on patient demographics, duration of anesthesia and surgery, intraoperative opioids, local anesthetic infiltration, surgical procedure reports, along with pain scores, postoperative PCA use, and opioid-related complications and hospital stays. Patients were divided into two groups - simple appendicitis without peritonitis and appendicitis with generalized peritonitis. RESULTS: The incidence of substantial pain when the multimodal regimen was used was 12%, which is significantly lower than earlier reports (Fisher's exact test P < 0.001). Patients with generalized peritonitis experienced more pain, consumed more opioids, had more unmet PCA demands, and a higher incidence of respiratory depression compared with those with simple appendicitis. CONCLUSION: The multimodal regimen of local anesthetic infiltration, opioid by PCA, NSAIDs, and oral acetaminophen/hydrocodone reduced the incidence of substantial pain. Additional studies are required to identify subgroups of patients with minimal opioid requirements who can benefit from modifications of this regimen.",

We assessed the frequency, clinical features, treatment, and outcome of a series of patients with UV. We conducted a retrospective study of patients with UV included in a large series of unselected patients with CV from a university hospital. Of 766 patients with CV, UV was diagnosed in 21 (2.7%; 9 male and 12 female patients; median age, 35 yr; range, 1-78 yr; interquartile range, 5-54 yr). Eight of the 21 cases were aged younger than 20 years old. Potential precipitating factors were upper respiratory tract infections and drugs (penicillin) (n = 4; in all cases in patients aged <20 yr), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (n = 1), and malignancy (n = 1). Besides urticarial lesions, other features such as palpable purpura (n = 7), arthralgia and/or arthritis (n = 13), abdominal pain (n = 2), nephropathy (n = 2), and peripheral neuropathy (n = 1) were observed. Hypocomplementemia (low C4) with low C1q was disclosed in 2 patients. Other abnormal laboratory findings were leukocytosis (n = 7), increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (n = 6), anemia (n = 4), and antinuclear antibody positivity (n = 2). Treatment included corticosteroids (n = 12), antihistaminic drugs (n = 6), chloroquine (n = 4), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (n = 3), colchicine (n = 2), and azathioprine (n = 1). After a median follow-up of 10 months (interquartile range, 2-38 mo) recurrences were observed in 4 patients. Apart from 1 patient who died because of an underlying malignancy, the outcome was good with full recovery in the remaining patients. In conclusion, our results indicate that UV is rare but not exceptional. In children UV is often preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection. Urticarial lesions and joint manifestations are the most frequent clinical manifestation. Low complement serum levels are observed in a minority of cases. The prognosis is generally good, but depends on the underlying disease.",

		"abstract": "Urticarial vasculitis (UV) is a subset of cutaneous vasculitis (CV), characterized clinically by urticarial skin lesions of more than 24 hours' duration and histologically by leukocytoclastic vasculitis. We assessed the frequency, clinical features, treatment, and outcome of a series of patients with UV. We conducted a retrospective study of patients with UV included in a large series of unselected patients with CV from a university hospital. Of 766 patients with CV, UV was diagnosed in 21 (2.7%; 9 male and 12 female patients; median age, 35 yr; range, 1-78 yr; interquartile range, 5-54 yr). Eight of the 21 cases were aged younger than 20 years old. Potential precipitating factors were upper respiratory tract infections and drugs (penicillin) (n = 4; in all cases in patients aged <20 yr), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (n = 1), and malignancy (n = 1). Besides urticarial lesions, other features such as palpable purpura (n = 7), arthralgia and/or arthritis (n = 13), abdominal pain (n = 2), nephropathy (n = 2), and peripheral neuropathy (n = 1) were observed. Hypocomplementemia (low C4) with low C1q was disclosed in 2 patients. Other abnormal laboratory findings were leukocytosis (n = 7), increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (n = 6), anemia (n = 4), and antinuclear antibody positivity (n = 2). Treatment included corticosteroids (n = 12), antihistaminic drugs (n = 6), chloroquine (n = 4), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (n = 3), colchicine (n = 2), and azathioprine (n = 1). After a median follow-up of 10 months (interquartile range, 2-38 mo) recurrences were observed in 4 patients. Apart from 1 patient who died because of an underlying malignancy, the outcome was good with full recovery in the remaining patients. In conclusion, our results indicate that UV is rare but not exceptional. In children UV is often preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection. Urticarial lesions and joint manifestations are the most frequent clinical manifestation. Low complement serum levels are observed in a minority of cases. The prognosis is generally good, but depends on the underlying disease.",

The prevalence of NSAID hypersensitivity in Chinese patients with CRS is low, which is a distinct clinical characteristic of Chinese CRS patients.

We examined the association of prenatal and infant (first 6 months) paracetamol exposure with asthma development while addressing confounding by indication.

We calculated adjusted relative risks (adj. RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using log-binomial regression. RESULTS: There were independent modest associations between asthma at 3 years with prenatal paracetamol exposure (adj. RR 1.13; 95% CI: 1.02-1.25) and use of paracetamol during infancy (adj.

The associations with prenatal paracetamol exposure were seen for different indications (pain, respiratory tract infections/influenza and fever). Maternal pain during pregnancy was the only indication that showed an association both with and without paracetamol use. Maternal paracetamol use outside pregnancy and paternal paracetamol use were not associated with asthma development. In a secondary analysis, prenatal ibuprofen exposure was positively associated with asthma at 3 years but not asthma at 7 years.

RESULTS: Across a large number of comparisons, aspirin was superior to placebo in treating pain, cold or fever. Efficacy was essentially similar to that of comparators used in equivalent doses.

Our previous efforts focused on improving blood-brain-barrier penetration and enhancing the metabolic stability of galanin analogs to protect against seizures.

Results obtained with NAX 409-9 in these tests were compared with the representative analgesics gabapentin, ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, and morphine. In mice that received intraplantar carrageenan, NAX 409-9 increased paw withdrawal latency with an ED50 of 6.6 mg/kg i.p. NAX 409-9 also increased the paw withdrawal threshold to mechanical stimulation following partial sciatic nerve ligation in rats (2 mg/kg). Conversely, NAX 409-9 had no effect in the tail flick or hot plate assays (up to 24 mg/kg). Importantly, NAX 409-9 did not negatively affect gastrointestinal motility (4-20 mg/kg), respiratory rate (40-80 mg/kg), or bleed time (20 mg/kg). These studies illustrate that this nonbrain-penetrating galanin analog reduces pain behaviors in several models and does not produce some of the dose-limiting toxicities associated with other analgesics.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 21-year-old woman presented erythema nodosum associated with painful bilateral inguinal adenopathy, odynophagia, joint pain and evening urticaria in a setting of impaired general condition. Initial serological testing for Bartonella henselae was negative. PCR for Bartonella henselae performed on an adenectomy fragment was positive. A favourable outcome was achieved with azithromycin. COMMENTS: This case shows an atypical and severe presentation of cat scratch disease and raises the problem of sensitivity of serotyping.",

De Quervain's thyroiditis (also termed giant cell or granulomatous thyroiditis) is a subacute inflammation of the thyroid, which accounts for 5% of thyroid disorders. The etiology is unknown, it usually appears two weeks after an upper viral respiratory infection. The clinical feature includes neck pain, which is aggravated during swallowing, and radiates to the ear. On palpation, the thyroid is exquisitely tender. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is markedly elevated, the leukocyte count, C-reactive protein are normal or slightly elevated. The natural history of granulomatous thyroiditis involves four phases: the destructive inflammation results temporarily in hyperthyroidism followed by euthyroidism. After a transient hypothyroidism the disease becomes inactive and the thyroid function is normalised. Ultrasonographic findings are diffuse hypoechogenic structures, but nodules may also occur. The disease often remains unrecognised, or the first phase of the disease is diagnosed and treated as hyperthyroidism. The diagnosis can be confirmed by the presence of the thyroid autoantibodies, radioiodine uptake and fine needle aspiration cytology. There is no special treatment, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs or steroid should be given to relieve the pain. The aim of the authors is to shed light the key points of diagnosis and differential diagnosis by the presentation of four slightly different cases.\rPublisher: A pajzsmirigy gyulladasos megbetegedesei klinikai megjelenesuk alapjan heveny, szubakut es kronikus formakba oszthatok.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a phase II, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled trial on the safety of the Russian-backbone, seasonal trivalent LAIV among children aged 24 through 59 months in Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2012. After vaccination, we monitored participants for six months with weekly home visits and study clinic surveillance for solicited and unsolicited adverse events, protocol-defined wheezing illness (PDWI), and serious adverse events (SAEs), including all cause hospitalizations. RESULTS: Three hundred children were randomized and administered LAIV (n=150) or placebo (n=150). No immediate post-vaccination reactions occurred in either group. Solicited reactions were similar between vaccine and placebo groups during the first 7 days post-vaccination and throughout the entire trial. There were no statistically significant differences in participants experiencing PDWI between LAIV and placebo groups throughout the trial (n=13 vs. n=16, p=0.697). Of 131 children with a history of medical treatment or hospitalization for asthma or wheezing at study entry, 65 received LAIV and 66 received placebo. Among this subset, there was no statistical difference in PDWI occurring throughout the trial between the LAIV or placebo groups (7.7% vs. 19.7%, p=0.074). While there were no related SAEs, LAIV recipients had six unrelated SAEs and placebo recipients had none. These SAEs included three due to traumatic injury and bone fracture, and one each due to accidental overdose of paracetamol, abdominal pain, and acute gastroenteritis. None of the participants with SAEs had laboratory-confirmed influenza, wheezing illness, or other signs of acute respiratory illness at the time of their events. CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized, controlled trial among 300 children aged 24 through 59 months in urban Bangladesh, Russian-backbone LAIV was safe and well tolerated. Further evaluation of LAIV safety and efficacy in a larger cohort is warranted.",

		"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Live-attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIVs) have the potential to be affordable, effective, and logistically feasible for immunization of children in low-resource settings. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a phase II, randomized, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled trial on the safety of the Russian-backbone, seasonal trivalent LAIV among children aged 24 through 59 months in Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2012. After vaccination, we monitored participants for six months with weekly home visits and study clinic surveillance for solicited and unsolicited adverse events, protocol-defined wheezing illness (PDWI), and serious adverse events (SAEs), including all cause hospitalizations. RESULTS: Three hundred children were randomized and administered LAIV (n=150) or placebo (n=150). No immediate post-vaccination reactions occurred in either group. Solicited reactions were similar between vaccine and placebo groups during the first 7 days post-vaccination and throughout the entire trial. There were no statistically significant differences in participants experiencing PDWI between LAIV and placebo groups throughout the trial (n=13 vs. n=16, p=0.697). Of 131 children with a history of medical treatment or hospitalization for asthma or wheezing at study entry, 65 received LAIV and 66 received placebo. Among this subset, there was no statistical difference in PDWI occurring throughout the trial between the LAIV or placebo groups (7.7% vs. 19.7%, p=0.074). While there were no related SAEs, LAIV recipients had six unrelated SAEs and placebo recipients had none. These SAEs included three due to traumatic injury and bone fracture, and one each due to accidental overdose of paracetamol, abdominal pain, and acute gastroenteritis. None of the participants with SAEs had laboratory-confirmed influenza, wheezing illness, or other signs of acute respiratory illness at the time of their events. CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized, controlled trial among 300 children aged 24 through 59 months in urban Bangladesh, Russian-backbone LAIV was safe and well tolerated. Further evaluation of LAIV safety and efficacy in a larger cohort is warranted.",

No dropout or uncompleted procedure occurred in the present study. Minor complications included sore throat, moderate oedema, mild acute pharynx inflammation, slight peritonsillar exudate and local burning. The postoperative pain, measured by Scott-Huskisson visual analogue scale, was between 5 and 40 mm and was easily counteracted by means of external ice packages and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, according to the individual patient's need. During the 12-36-month follow-up patients showed improved symptoms (n=7) and complete recovery (n=13). A relapse episode was observed in two patients.

In contrast, LXA4 reversed LPS-inhibited ENaC-gamma expression through inhibition of AP-1 and activation of PTEN. In addition, an miR-21 inhibitor mimicked the effects of LXA4; overexpression of miR-21 abolished the protective effects of LXA4. Finally, both AKT and ERK inhibitors (LY294002 and UO126) blocked effects of LPS on the depression of ENaC-gamma. However, LXA4 only inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of AKT.

Migraine is a common, disabling condition and a burden for the individual, health services and society. Many sufferers do not seek professional help, relying instead on over-the-counter analgesics. Co-therapy with an antiemetic should help to reduce symptoms commonly associated with migraine headaches. OBJECTIVES: To determine efficacy and tolerability of ibuprofen, alone or in combination with an antiemetic, compared to placebo and other active interventions in the treatment of acute migraine headaches in adults. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Oxford Pain Relief Database, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists for studies through 22 April 2010 for the original review and to 14 February 2013 for the update. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised, double-blind, placebo- or active-controlled studies using self-administered ibuprofen to treat a migraine headache episode, with at least 10 participants per treatment arm. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Numbers of participants achieving each outcome were used to calculate relative risk and number needed to treat (NNT) or harm (NNH) compared to placebo or other active treatment. MAIN RESULTS: No new studies were found for this update. Nine included studies (4373 participants, 5223 attacks) compared ibuprofen with placebo or other active comparators; none combined ibuprofen with a self-administered antiemetic. All studies treated attacks with single doses of medication. For ibuprofen 400 mg versus placebo, NNTs for 2-hour pain-free (26% versus 12% with placebo), 2-hour headache relief (57% versus 25%) and 24-hour sustained headache relief (45% versus 19%) were 7.2, 3.2 and 4.0, respectively. For ibuprofen 200 mg versus placebo, NNTs for 2-hour pain-free (20% versus 10%) and 2-hour headache relief (52% versus 37%) were 9.7 and 6.3, respectively. The higher dose was significantly better than the lower dose for 2-hour headache relief. Soluble formulations of ibuprofen 400 mg were better than standard tablets for 1-hour, but not 2-hour headache relief.Similar numbers of participants experienced adverse events, which were mostly mild and transient, with ibuprofen and placebo.Ibuprofen 400 mg did not differ from rofecoxib 25 mg for 2-hour headache relief or 24-hour headache relief. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no new studies since the last version of this review. Ibuprofen is an effective treatment for acute migraine headaches, providing pain relief in about half of sufferers, but complete relief from pain and associated symptoms for only a minority. NNTs for all efficacy outcomes were better with 400 mg than 200 mg in comparisons with placebo, and soluble formulations provided more rapid relief.

		"abstract": "IMPORTANCE: For treatment of malignant pleural effusion, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are avoided because they may reduce pleurodesis efficacy. Smaller chest tubes may be less painful than larger tubes, but efficacy in pleurodesis has not been proven. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of chest tube size and analgesia (NSAIDs vs opiates) on pain and clinical efficacy related to pleurodesis in patients with malignant pleural effusion. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 2x2 factorial phase 3 randomized clinical trial among 320 patients requiring pleurodesis in 16 UK hospitals from 2007 to 2013. INTERVENTIONS: Patients undergoing thoracoscopy (n = 206; clinical decision if biopsy was required) received a 24F chest tube and were randomized to receive opiates (n = 103) vs NSAIDs (n = 103), and those not undergoing thoracoscopy (n = 114) were randomized to 1 of 4 groups (24F chest tube and opioids [n = 28]; 24F chest tube and NSAIDs [n = 29]; 12F chest tube and opioids [n = 29]; or 12F chest tube and NSAIDs [n = 28]). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Pain while chest tube was in place (0- to 100-mm visual analog scale [VAS] 4 times/d; superiority comparison) and pleurodesis efficacy at 3 months (failure defined as need for further pleural intervention; noninferiority comparison; margin, 15%). RESULTS: Pain scores in the opiate group (n = 150) vs the NSAID group (n = 144) were not significantly different (mean VAS score, 23.8 mm vs 22.1 mm; adjusted difference, -1.5 mm; 95% CI, -5.0 to 2.0 mm; P = .40), but the NSAID group required more rescue analgesia (26.3% vs 38.1%; rate ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3-3.4; P = .003). Pleurodesis failure occurred in 30 patients (20%) in the opiate group and 33 (23%) in the NSAID group, meeting criteria for noninferiority (difference, -3%; 1-sided 95% CI, -10% to infinity; P = .004 for noninferiority). Pain scores were lower among patients in the 12F chest tube group (n = 54) vs the 24F group (n = 56) (mean VAS score, 22.0 mm vs 26.8 mm; adjusted difference, -6.0 mm; 95% CI, -11.7 to -0.2 mm; P = .04) and 12F chest tubes vs 24F chest tubes were associated with higher pleurodesis failure (30% vs 24%), failing to meet noninferiority criteria (difference, -6%; 1-sided 95% CI, -20% to infinity; P = .14 for noninferiority). Complications during chest tube insertion occurred more commonly with 12F tubes (14% vs 24%; odds ratio, 1.91; P = .20). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Use of NSAIDs vs opiates resulted in no significant difference in pain scores but was associated with more rescue medication. NSAID use resulted in noninferior rates of pleurodesis efficacy at 3 months. Placement of 12F chest tubes vs 24F chest tubes was associated with a statistically significant but clinically modest reduction in pain but failed to meet noninferiority criteria for pleurodesis efficacy.

		"abstract": "IMPORTANCE: For treatment of malignant pleural effusion, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are avoided because they may reduce pleurodesis efficacy. Smaller chest tubes may be less painful than larger tubes, but efficacy in pleurodesis has not been proven. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of chest tube size and analgesia (NSAIDs vs opiates) on pain and clinical efficacy related to pleurodesis in patients with malignant pleural effusion. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 2x2 factorial phase 3 randomized clinical trial among 320 patients requiring pleurodesis in 16 UK hospitals from 2007 to 2013. INTERVENTIONS: Patients undergoing thoracoscopy (n = 206; clinical decision if biopsy was required) received a 24F chest tube and were randomized to receive opiates (n = 103) vs NSAIDs (n = 103), and those not undergoing thoracoscopy (n = 114) were randomized to 1 of 4 groups (24F chest tube and opioids [n = 28]; 24F chest tube and NSAIDs [n = 29]; 12F chest tube and opioids [n = 29]; or 12F chest tube and NSAIDs [n = 28]). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Pain while chest tube was in place (0- to 100-mm visual analog scale [VAS] 4 times/d; superiority comparison) and pleurodesis efficacy at 3 months (failure defined as need for further pleural intervention; noninferiority comparison; margin, 15%). RESULTS: Pain scores in the opiate group (n = 150) vs the NSAID group (n = 144) were not significantly different (mean VAS score, 23.8 mm vs 22.1 mm; adjusted difference, -1.5 mm; 95% CI, -5.0 to 2.0 mm; P = .40), but the NSAID group required more rescue analgesia (26.3% vs 38.1%; rate ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3-3.4; P = .003). Pleurodesis failure occurred in 30 patients (20%) in the opiate group and 33 (23%) in the NSAID group, meeting criteria for noninferiority (difference, -3%; 1-sided 95% CI, -10% to infinity; P = .004 for noninferiority). Pain scores were lower among patients in the 12F chest tube group (n = 54) vs the 24F group (n = 56) (mean VAS score, 22.0 mm vs 26.8 mm; adjusted difference, -6.0 mm; 95% CI, -11.7 to -0.2 mm; P = .04) and 12F chest tubes vs 24F chest tubes were associated with higher pleurodesis failure (30% vs 24%), failing to meet noninferiority criteria (difference, -6%; 1-sided 95% CI, -20% to infinity; P = .14 for noninferiority). Complications during chest tube insertion occurred more commonly with 12F tubes (14% vs 24%; odds ratio, 1.91; P = .20). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Use of NSAIDs vs opiates resulted in no significant difference in pain scores but was associated with more rescue medication. NSAID use resulted in noninferior rates of pleurodesis efficacy at 3 months. Placement of 12F chest tubes vs 24F chest tubes was associated with a statistically significant but clinically modest reduction in pain but failed to meet noninferiority criteria for pleurodesis efficacy.

The conventional method of comparing mean treatment responses at each time point was also implemented. Demulcent action was detected at the first 2-minute assessment. By the new method, 102 flurbiprofen-treated patients were identified as first perceiving pain relief at 12 minutes, compared with >120 minutes by 102 patients using placebo (P<0.001). By the conventional method, mean percentage pain reduction for flurbiprofen 8.75 mg was first significantly differentiated from placebo at 26 minutes (P<0.05). Efficacy of flurbiprofen lozenge was demonstrated for 3.5-4hours on the 4 patient-reported outcomes (all P<0.05 compared with placebo). There were no serious adverse events. This patient-centered onset-of-action model identifies the initiation of pain relief in patients who are definite drug responders, here demonstrating that a flurbiprofen 8.75-mg lozenge provides early relief of sore throat.",

The conventional method of comparing mean treatment responses at each time point was also implemented. Demulcent action was detected at the first 2-minute assessment. By the new method, 102 flurbiprofen-treated patients were identified as first perceiving pain relief at 12 minutes, compared with >120 minutes by 102 patients using placebo (P<0.001). By the conventional method, mean percentage pain reduction for flurbiprofen 8.75 mg was first significantly differentiated from placebo at 26 minutes (P<0.05). Efficacy of flurbiprofen lozenge was demonstrated for 3.5-4hours on the 4 patient-reported outcomes (all P<0.05 compared with placebo). There were no serious adverse events. This patient-centered onset-of-action model identifies the initiation of pain relief in patients who are definite drug responders, here demonstrating that a flurbiprofen 8.75-mg lozenge provides early relief of sore throat.",

The model used here was designed to study the multiple-dose safety and efficacy of lozenges containing flurbiprofen at 8.75 mg. METHODS: Adults (n=198) with moderate or severe acute sore throat and findings of pharyngitis on a Tonsillo-Pharyngitis Assessment (TPA) were randomly assigned to use either flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenges (n=101) or matching placebo lozenges (n=97) under double-blind conditions. Patients sucked one lozenge every three to six hours as needed, up to five lozenges per day, and rated symptoms on 100-mm scales: the Sore Throat Pain Intensity Scale (STPIS), the Difficulty Swallowing Scale (DSS), and the Swollen Throat Scale (SwoTS). RESULTS: Reductions in pain (lasting for three hours) and in difficulty swallowing and throat swelling (for four hours) were observed after a single dose of the flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenge (P<0.05 compared with placebo). After using multiple doses over 24 hours, flurbiprofen-treated patients experienced a 59% greater reduction in throat pain, 45% less difficulty swallowing, and 44% less throat swelling than placebo-treated patients (all P<0.01). There were no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing the sore throat pain model with multiple doses over 24 hours, flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenges were shown to be an effective, well-tolerated treatment for sore throat pain. Other pharmacologic actions (reduced difficulty swallowing and reduced throat swelling) and overall patient satisfaction from the flurbiprofen lozenges were also demonstrated in this multiple-dose implementation of the sore throat pain model.

Most patients with sore throat seek symptom relief rather than antibiotics, therefore, therapies that relieve symptoms should be recommended to patients. We report two clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of flurbiprofen 8.75 mg lozenge in patients with and without streptococcal sore throat. METHODS: The studies enrolled adults with moderate-to-severe throat symptoms (sore throat pain, difficulty swallowing and swollen throat) and a diagnosis of pharyngitis. The practitioner assessed the likelihood of Strep A infection based on historical and clinical findings. Patients were randomised to flurbiprofen 8.75 mg or placebo lozenges under double-blind conditions and reported the three throat symptoms at baseline and at regular intervals over 24 h. RESULTS: A total of 402 patients received study medication (n = 203 flurbiprofen, n = 199 placebo). Throat culture identified Strep A in 10.0% of patients and group C streptococcus (Strep C) in a further 14.0%. The practitioners' assessments correctly diagnosed Strep A in 11/40 cases (sensitivity 27.5%, and specificity 79.7%). A single flurbiprofen lozenge provided significantly greater relief than placebo for all three throat symptoms, lasting 3-4 h for patients with and without Strep A/C. Multiple doses of flurbiprofen lozenges over 24 h also led to symptom relief, although not statistically significant in the Strep A/C group. There were no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the challenge of identifying Strep A based on clinical features. With the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, non-antibiotic treatments should be considered.

We present the clinical course of a patient who initially presented to the emergency department after overdosing on ibuprofen for what he described as back pain secondary to mechanical injury.

		"abstract": "Surgery of the tonsils is still one of the most frequent procedures during childhood. Due to a series of fatal outcome after hemorrhage in children in Austria in 2006, the standards and indications for tonsillectomy slowly change in Germany since that. However, there exist no national guidelines and the frequency of tonsil surgery varies in the country. In some districts eight times more children were tonsillectomized than in others. A tonsillectomy in children under 6 years should only be done if the child suffers from recurrent acute bacterially tonsillitis. In all other cases (i. e. hyperplasia of the tonsils) the low risk partial tonsillectomy should be the first line therapy. Postoperative pain and the risk of hemorrhage are much lower in partial tonsillectomy (= tonsillotomy). No matter whether the tonsillotomy is done by laser, radiofrequency, shaver, coblation, bipolar scissor or Colorado needle, as long as the crypts are kept open and some tonsil tissue is left behind. Total extracapsular tonsillectomy is still indicated in severely affected children with recurrent infections of the tonsils, allergy to antibiotics, PFAPA syndrome (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis) and peritonsillar abscess. With regard to the frequency and seriousness of the recurrent tonsillitis the indication for tonsillectomy in children is justified if 7 or more well-documented, clinically important, adequately treated episodes of throat infection occur in the preceding year, or 5 or more such episodes occur in each of the 2 preceding years (according to the paradise criteria). Diagnosis of acute tonsillitis is clinical, but sometimes it is hard to distinguish viral from bacterial infections. Rapid antigen testing has a very low sensitivity in the diagnosis of bacterial tonsillitis and swabs are highly sensitive but take a long time. In all microbiological tests the treating physician has to keep in mind, that most of the bacterials, viruses and fungi belong to the healthy flora and do no harm. Ten percent of the healthy children bear even streptococcus pyogenes all the time in the tonsils with no clinical signs. In these children decolonization is not necessary. Therefore, microbiological screening tests in children without symptoms are senseless and do not justify an antibiotic treatment (which is sometimes postulated by the kindergartens). The acute tonsillitis should be treated with steroids (e.g. dexamethasone), NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofene) and betalactam antibiotics (e.g. penicillin or cefuroxime). With respect to the symptom reduction and primary healing the short-term late-generation antibiotic therapy (azithromycin, clarithromycin or cephalosporine for 3 to 5 days) is comparable to the long-term penicilline therapy. There is no difference in the course of healing, recurrence or microbiological resistance between the short-term penicilline therapy to the standard 10 days therapy, as well. On the other hand, only the 10 days antibiotic therapy has prooven to be effective in the prevention of rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritic diseases. The incidence of rheumatic heart disease is currently 0.5 per 100.000 children in school age. The main morbidity after tonsillectomy is pain and the late hemorrhage. Posttonsillectomy bleeding can occur till the whole wound is completely healed, which is normally after 3 weeks. Life-threatening hemorrhages occur often after smaller bleedings, which can spontaneously cease. That is why every hemorrhage, even the smallest, has to be treated properly and in ward. Patients and parents have to be informed about the correct behavior in case of hemorrhage with a written consent before the surgery. The handout should contain important adresses, phone numbers and contact persons. Almost all cases of fatal outcome after tonsillectomy were due to false management of hemorrhage. Especially in small children hemorrhage can be life-threatening because of the lower blood volume and the danger of aspiration with asphyxia. A massive hemorrhage is an extreme challenge for every paramedic or emergency doctor because of the difficult airway management. Intubation is only possible with appropriate unflexible suction tubes. All different surgical techniques have the risk of hemorrhage and even the best surgeon will experience a postoperative hemorrhage. The lowest risk of hemorrhage is after cold dissection with ligature or suturing. All \"hot\" techniques with laser, radiofrequency, coblation, mono- or bipolar forceps have a higher risk of late hemorrhage. Children with a hereditary coagulopathy have a higher risk of hemorrhage. It is possible, that these children were not identified before surgery. Therefore it is recommended by the Society of paediatrics, anaesthesia and ENT, that a standardised questionnaire should be answered by the parents before tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. This 17-points-checklist questionnaire is more sensitive and easier to perform than a screening with blood tests (e.g. INR and PTT). Unfortunately, a lot of surgeons still screen the children preoperatively by coagulative blood tests, although these test are inappropiate and incapable of detecting the von Willebrand disease, which is the most often coagulopathy in Europe. The preoperative information about the surgery should be done with the child and the parents in a calm and objective atmosphere with a written consent. A copy of the consent with the signature of the surgeon and both custodial parents has to be handed out to the parents.",

OBJECTIVES: We compared the efficacy of paracetamol/controlled-release (CR) oxycodone and paracetamol/naproxen for treatment of acute postoperative pain at home after ambulatory surgery. Secondary outcomes were adverse effects of study medication, treatment satisfaction, and postoperative analgesic compliance. METHODS: Patients undergoing ambulatory knee arthroscopy or inguinal hernia repair surgery (n = 105) were randomized into 3 groups: Group1 paracetamol/naproxen (n = 35), Group 2 paracetamol/CR oxycodone for 24 hours (n = 35), and Group 3 paracetamol/CR oxycodone for 48 hours (n = 35). Pain intensity at movement and at rest using a visual analog scale as well as satisfaction with postoperative analgesia and side effects were recorded for up to 48 hours postoperatively. Compliance with study medication was also assessed. RESULTS: For pain at movement and at rest, no significant differences were found between the paracetamol/naproxen group and either the paracetamol/CR oxycodone for 24 hours group (beta = 2.6 [4.9]; P = 0.597) or the paracetamol/CR oxycodone for 48 hours (beta = -1.7 [5.1]; P = 0.736). No major adverse effects of study medication were registered and satisfaction with postoperative pain treatment was high in all groups. Compliance was comparable across the groups. Despite clear instructions, 8 patients with the lowest pain scores did not use any of the prescribed pain medication. CONCLUSIONS: Paracetamol/CR oxycodone and paracetamol/naproxen are equally effective in treatment of acute postoperative pain at home after ambulatory surgery with comparable patient satisfaction level. We suggest paracetamol/CR oxycodone to be a valuable alternative for the current paracetamol/naproxen gold standard, particularly in patients with a contraindication for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

The most common is Hashimoto thyroiditis; patients typically present with a nontender goiter, hypothyroidism, and an elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody level. Treatment with levothyroxine ameliorates the hypothyroidism and may reduce goiter size. Postpartum thyroiditis is transient or persistent thyroid dysfunction that occurs within one year of childbirth, miscarriage, or medical abortion. Release of preformed thyroid hormone into the bloodstream may result in hyperthyroidism.

		"abstract": "Thyroiditis is a general term that encompasses several clinical disorders characterized by inflammation of the thyroid gland. The most common is Hashimoto thyroiditis; patients typically present with a nontender goiter, hypothyroidism, and an elevated thyroid peroxidase antibody level. Treatment with levothyroxine ameliorates the hypothyroidism and may reduce goiter size. Postpartum thyroiditis is transient or persistent thyroid dysfunction that occurs within one year of childbirth, miscarriage, or medical abortion. Release of preformed thyroid hormone into the bloodstream may result in hyperthyroidism. This may be followed by transient or permanent hypothyroidism as a result of depletion of thyroid hormone stores and destruction of thyroid hormone-producing cells. Patients should be monitored for changes in thyroid function. Beta blockers can treat symptoms in the initial hyperthyroid phase; in the subsequent hypothyroid phase, levothyroxine should be considered in women with a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level greater than 10 mIU per L, or in women with a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 4 to 10 mIU per L who are symptomatic or desire fertility.

Therefore, the authors wanted to determine if a quality improvement initiative centered on a standardized analgesia protocol could significantly reduce postoperative pain among neurosurgery patients. METHODS The authors implemented a 10-month, prospective, interrupted time-series trial of a quality improvement initiative. The intervention consisted of a multimodal, interdepartmental, standardized analgesia protocol with process improvements from preadmission to discharge. All neurosurgical-floor patients participated in the quality improvement intervention, with data collected on a systematically randomly sampled subset of 96 patients for detailed analysis. Patient-reported numeric rating scale pain on the first postoperative day (POD) served as the primary outcome. RESULTS Implementation of the analgesia protocol resulted in improved preoperative and postoperative documentation of pain (p < 0.001) and improved use of multimodal analgesia, including use of NSAIDs (p < 0.009) and gabapentin (p < 0.027). This intervention also correlated with a 32% reduction in reported pain on the 1st POD for all neurosurgical patients (mean pain scale scores 4.31 vs 2.94; p = 0.000) and a 43% reduction among spinal surgery patients (mean pain scale scores 5.45 vs 3.10; p = 0.036). After controlling for covariates, implementation of the protocol was a significant predictor of lowered postoperative pain (p = 0.05) on the 1st POD. This reduction in pain correlated with protocol compliance (p = 0.028), and a significant decrease in the monthly number of naloxone doses suggests improved safety (mean dose +/- SD 1.5 +/- 1.0 vs 0.33 +/- 0.5; p = 0.04). Furthermore, a significant and persistent reduction in the pain management component of the HCAHPS scores suggests a durability of results extending beyond the life of the study (72.1% vs 82.0%; p = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS The implementation of a standardized analgesia protocol can significantly reduce postoperative pain among neurosurgical patients while increasing safety.

RESULTS: Group I had more shoulder pain events compared to other groups (p= 0.002) in the same way the group IV required less rescue analgesia (p= 0.034).

In paediatric populations, ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) are both commonly used over-the-counter medicines for the management of fever or mild-to-moderate pain associated with sore throat, otitis media, toothache, earache and headache. Widespread use of ibuprofen and paracetamol has shown that they are both effective and generally well tolerated in the reduction in paediatric fever and pain. However, ibuprofen has the advantage of less frequent dosing (every 6-8 h vs. every 4 h for paracetamol) and its longer duration of action makes it a suitable alternative to paracetamol. In comparative trials, ibuprofen has been shown to be at least as effective as paracetamol as an analgesic and more effective as an antipyretic. The safety profile of ibuprofen is comparable to that of paracetamol if both drugs are used appropriately with the correct dosing regimens. However, in the overdose situation, the toxicity of paracetamol is not only reached much earlier, but is also more severe and more difficult to manage as compared with an overdose of ibuprofen. There is clearly a need for advanced studies to investigate the safety of these medications in paediatric populations of different ages and especially during prolonged use. Finally, the recently reported association between frequency and severity of asthma and paracetamol use needs urgent additional investigations.",

METHODS: A 1-year, multicenter, open-label trial of 246 patients enrolled from March 2006 to July 2009 was conducted. Patients received etanercept 50 mg subcutaneously twice weekly for 3 months and then 50 mg once weekly for 9 months. The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving a PGA score </= 2 at month 12. Secondary end points included the proportion of patients achieving PGA score </= 2 at months 3, 6, and 9 and change from baseline at month 12 for Patient Global Assessment (PtGA), body surface area, and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Adverse events were reported. RESULTS: At month 12, 73.5% (95% CI 67.2-79.1) achieved a PGA score </= 2. The response was similar regardless of the previous response to systemic or phototherapy. The proportion of patients achieving this score improved from 2.2% (95% CI 0.3-4.2) at baseline to 73.5% (95% CI 67.2-79.1) at 12 months. At 12 months, patients with a DLQI score of 0 or >/= 5-point improvement was 28.8% (95% CI 22.9-34.7) and 47.3% (95% CI 40.8-53.9), respectively. No new safety signals were reported. CONCLUSION: The majority of this Canadian population demonstrated a meaningful improvement in PGA and DLQI scores over 1 year.",

METHODS: A 1-year, multicenter, open-label trial of 246 patients enrolled from March 2006 to July 2009 was conducted.

The related impairment of daily functioning and quality of life is attributable to symptoms such as facial pain and nasal congestion. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of systemic corticosteroids on clinical response rates and to determine adverse effects and relapse rates of systemic corticosteroids compared to placebo or standard clinical care in children and adults with acute sinusitis. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February week 1, 2014) and EMBASE (January 2009 to February 2014). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing systemic corticosteroids to placebo or standard clinical care for patients with acute sinusitis. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Five RCTs with a total of 1193 adult participants met our inclusion criteria. We judged methodological quality to be moderate in four trials and high in one trial. Acute sinusitis was defined clinically in all trials. However, the three trials performed in ear, nose and throat (ENT) outpatient clinics also used radiological assessment as part of their inclusion criteria. All participants were assigned to either oral corticosteroids (prednisone 24 mg to 80 mg daily or betamethasone 1 mg daily) or the control treatment (placebo in four trials and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in one trial). In four trials antibiotics were prescribed in addition to oral corticosteroids or control treatment, while one trial investigated the effects of oral corticosteroids as a monotherapy.When combining data from the five trials, participants treated with oral corticosteroids were more likely to have short-term resolution or improvement of symptoms than those receiving the control treatment: at days three to seven (risk ratio (RR) 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 1.6; risk difference (RD) 17%, 95% CI 6% to 29%) and at days four to 14 (RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.5; RD 14%, 95% CI 1% to 27%). A sensitivity analysis including the four trials with placebo as a control treatment showed similar results but with a lesser effect size: at days three to seven (RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.3; RD 11%, 95% CI 4% to 17%) and days four to 14 (RR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.2; RD 8%, 95% CI 2% to 13%). Statistical heterogeneity was high for many analyses. Subgroup analyses revealed that corticosteroid monotherapy had no beneficial effects. Furthermore, scenario analysis showed that outcomes missing from the trial reports might have introduced attrition bias (a worst-case scenario showed no statistically significant beneficial effect of oral corticosteroids). No trial reported effects on relapse or recurrence rates. Reported side effects in patients treated with oral corticosteroids were mild (nausea, vomiting, gastric complaints) and did not significantly differ from those receiving placebo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Oral corticosteroids as a monotherapy appear to be ineffective for adult patients with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis. Current data on the use of oral corticosteroids as an adjunctive therapy to oral antibiotics are limited: almost all trials are performed in secondary care settings and there is a significant risk of bias. This limited evidence suggests that oral corticosteroids in combination with antibiotics may be modestly beneficial for short-term relief of symptoms in acute sinusitis, with a number needed to treat to benefit of seven for resolution or symptom improvement. A large primary care factorial trial is needed to establish whether oral corticosteroids offer additional benefits over antibiotics in acute sinusitis.",

		"abstract": "Guillain-Barre syndrome consists of a group of neuropathic conditions characterized by progressive weakness and diminished or absent myotatic reflexes. The estimated annual incidence in the United States is 1.65 to 1.79 per 100,000 persons. Guillain-Barre syndrome is believed to result from an aberrant immune response that attacks nerve tissue. This response may be triggered by surgery, immunizations, or infections. The most common form of the disease, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, presents as progressive motor weakness, usually beginning in the legs and advancing proximally. Symptoms typically peak within four weeks, then plateau before resolving. More than one-half of patients experience severe pain, and about two-thirds have autonomic symptoms, such as cardiac arrhythmias, blood pressure instability, or urinary retention. Advancing symptoms may compromise respiration and vital functions. Diagnosis is based on clinical features, cerebrospinal fluid testing, and nerve conduction studies. Cerebrospinal fluid testing shows increased protein levels but a normal white blood cell count. Nerve conduction studies show a slowing, or possible blockage, of conduction. Patients should be hospitalized for multidisciplinary supportive care and disease-modifying therapy. Supportive therapy includes controlling pain with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, carbamazepine, or gabapentin; monitoring for respiratory and autonomic complications; and preventing venous thrombosis, skin breakdown, and deconditioning. Plasma exchange therapy has been shown to improve short-term and long-term outcomes, and intravenous immune globulin has been shown to hasten recovery in adults and children. Other therapies, including corticosteroids, have not demonstrated benefit. About 3 percent of patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome die. Neurologic problems persist in up to 20 percent of patients with the disease, and one-half of these patients are severely disabled.",

Andrographolide, the primary component of a traditional medicinal herb, Andrographis paniculata, is widely used in China for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infection, and dysentery etc. The aim of the study was to identify and summarize any case of kidney injury attributed to its use in the Chinese literature. METHODS: A systemic analysis of the Chinese literature from January 1978 to August 2013 was conducted of case reports of andrographolide induced acute kidney injury (AKI). RESULTS: We identified 26 cases of andrographolide induced AKI (22 males and four females), with an average age of 31.3 years (range: 21 months to 47 years). 100-750 mg (58% 500 mg) of andrographolide was administered in 100-500 mL 5% glucose solution or normal saline by intravenous drip once a day. The adverse event appeared after one to six doses (19 [73.1%] patients got only one dose; cumulative dose 690 +/- 670 mg) of andrographolide was given, or 0-96 h (median 1 h) after andrographolide was given. The symptoms included flank pain in 23 cases (88.5%), decreased urine volume in five cases (19.2%), and nausea or vomiting in six cases (23.1%). Laboratory tests showed maximum creatinine 352.8 +/- 184.1 (158-889) mumol/L and blood urea nitrogen 12.1 +/- 7.6 (4.0-40.6) mmol/L. Urine analysis showed proteinuria in 10 (38.5%) cases and occult blood in eight (30.8%) cases. Kidney biopsy was carried out in two cases and both revealed acute tubular necrosis. Management of this adverse event included withdrawal of the culprit drug, conservative therapy, and renal replacement therapy (six cases, 23.1%). All the patients recovered and were discharged with a normal or close to normal serum creatinine. Their average length of hospital stay was 12.1 +/- 4.8 days. CONCLUSIONS: Acute kidney injury may occur shortly after intravenous infusion of andrographolide, with symptoms including flank pain, decreased urine output, and nausea or vomiting. The pathological change might be acute tubular necrosis. Renal replacement therapy may be needed in some patients and with a good recovery rate. The mechanisms of andrographolide induced AKI need to be further studied.",
