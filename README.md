ICASR Integration Engine
===================================
The ICASR Integration Engine (I3) is both a standard to define how individual Systematic Review Apps interact and a proof-of-concept implementation.

The I3 represents an attempt to define the integration between different Systematic Review apps with an aim to entirely automating the communication between these individual stages.
